The Dark Crypt. A several hundred year old structure. Originally a burial chamber built by some long-forgotten race, it lay undisturbed for a couple of centuries.  It was uncovered, opened, and stripped of its grave goods; then a group of bandits (or maybe they were a fugitive cult of devil-worshippers; it’s hard to say) dug out a secret hideaway behind the original tombs.  Other tenants moved in later.  It is now occupied by a tribe of cave trolls, who use it as a place from which to stage raids on nearby human and elven settlements. As a poor, simple adventurer, you've heard tales of the wealth stored within the crypt - and so you come, looking for your fortune.

The crypt was built into the side of a mountain, with an elaborate carved stone façade.It was later partially covered by landslides.You see what looks like a natural cave entrance, big enough for a man to enter comfortably. Only when you get inside do you notice that the walls are carved stone, covered with hauntingly beautiful patterns of interwoven lines and strange writing in a language no living man knows.

The burial chamber is elaborately decorated, and contains a stone sarcophagus.The lid is ajar, or off, and there’s a scattering of old bones(humanoid of some sort) inside.There is no treasure, and nothing of significance; the grave robbers came and went long ago.

There is a rickety wooden bridge spanning a 15 foot wide pit.  In the pit is what looks like tar or black oil; it’s actually a black slime monster that Nognor captured and, by means of a curse, has imprisoned here to serve as a trap.  The slime cannot move out of the pit or attack anyone on the bridge above.  The curse has made the slime immortal . . . but it hasn’t eaten in a couple centuries, and the bridge is quite dilapidated. Will it hold?
